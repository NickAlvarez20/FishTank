## Project Name
FishTank
## About
FishTank is an interactive web-based simulation built using JavaScript and the p5.js library. It creates a virtual aquarium where users can click anywhere on the canvas to spawn fish with randomized attributes such as color, body length, body height, tail size, and eye size. The tank is enhanced with design elements like pebbles, seaweed, bubbles, sand, and treasure chests, creating a visually engaging underwater scene.
## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need JavaScript enabled in a modern web browser on your system.
The p5.js library is required and is loaded via CDN in the HTML file. No additional libraries are needed.
## Features
This FishTank includes these features:

-Interactive fish generation via mouse clicks with randomized attributes (color, body length, height, tail size, eye size)

-Static design elements including pebbles, seaweed, bubbles, sand, and treasure chests for an immersive aquarium

-Smooth animations and rendering using p5.js

-Predefined fish and decorations for an initial populated tank

## Getting Started & Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
`git clone https://github.com/NickAlvarez20/FishTank.git`

## Usage
Open the index.html file in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox):

Click anywhere on the canvas to spawn a new fish with randomized attributes. 

The tank is pre-populated with fish and decorative elements like pebbles, seaweed, bubbles, sand, and treasure chests.
## Learning Outcomes
This project helped me:

-Master JavaScript and p5.js for interactive graphics and animations

-Implement event-driven programming with mouse click interactions

-Utilize random number generation for dynamic object creation

-Enhance visual design with static and dynamic elements in a canvas-based environment
